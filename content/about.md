Hi 👋! I'm David Lievrouw, a passionate software developer and technical leader from Belgium (🇧🇪). 

With over two decades of experience, I've grown into a technical leadership role, guiding people and shaping technology.

I bring a long-term perspective to every project, ensuring that the architecture and design are robust and adaptable to future changes.

Beyond the keyboard, I'm a motorsports enthusiast and sim racer 🏎️. My two sons 👦‍👦 are a constant source of inspiration, reminding me to approach every challenge with fresh eyes. 

I'm always open to new connections and collaborations – let's create something amazing together. 🚀
